		I have been in this industry and community for over 25 years and will enjoy the opportunity to apply my experience, education, and love of this profession to give you an enjoyable and satisfying salon experience. I always had a passion for hair and started experimenting with hair extension at the age of 16 years old. I specialize in many advanced hair extensions techniques and pride myself in healthy haircare and natural hair presses.</p>
